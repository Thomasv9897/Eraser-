### Project Description
A Python-based module management system that demonstrates advanced error handling and self-modifying code capabilities. 
The program systematically imports, executes, and removes modules while tracking execution counts, showcasing 
sophisticated module manipulation techniques.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever worried your code is too permanent? Tired of those pesky Python files cluttering your directory long after they've served their purpose?
Fear not! We've created a solution for the most unnecessary problem in software development - code that refuses to clean up after itself!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Self-Destructing Module Manager - the first-ever Python program that treats your modules like Mission Impossible messages!
It imports them, runs them, and then makes them disappear forever. Because why keep code around when you can watch it self-destruct in style?

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python 3.x
- OS Module
- File I/O Operations
- Exception Handling Framework

### Implementation

# Installation

#Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-destructing-module-manager

#Navigate to project directory
cd self-destructing-module-manager

#Ensure you have Python 3.x installed
python --version
# Run
#Create necessary module files (c1.py, c2.py, c3.py)
python setup.py

#Run the main program
python main.py
